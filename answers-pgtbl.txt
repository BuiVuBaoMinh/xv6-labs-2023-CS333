1. Which other xv6 system call(s) could be made faster using this shared page? Explain how.
Answer: Any system call that directly or indirectly invokes the copyout function will be accelerated, as it saves time on copying data. 
Additionally, system calls used purely for information retrieval, such as ugetpid in this section, will also be faster. 
This is because the operation of trapping into the operating system is no longer necessary, and the corresponding data can be read in user mode instead.
